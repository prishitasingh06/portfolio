    <h2>University Experience 🎓</h2>
    <p>
      I am a student at the University of Waterloo pursuing Computer Engineering. I am constantly seeking
      opportunities to apply my knowledge and gain hands-on experience, whether it's through personal
      projects or collaborative efforts with peers.
      In my free time, I love playing and watching tennis, as well as painting. I'm looking forward to co-op internships and research
      opportunities that will allow me to make a meaningful impact and expand my skills.
