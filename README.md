Welcome to my personal website showcasing my academic background, work experience, and interactive web projects, including a Ping Pong game and BMI calculator.

--Overview of my projects-

1. Ping Pong with Scoring (Web Edition)
An interactive two-player Ping Pong game built using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. The game features smooth paddle controls, realistic ball physics, and a scoring system to track each playerâ€™s points. Player 1 controls their paddle using the W and S keys, while Player 2 uses the arrow keys. The game is styled with a sleek dark theme and responsive design to provide an engaging and enjoyable experience.

2. Advanced BMI Calculator (Web Edition)
A user-friendly BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator designed with accessibility and flexibility in mind. Users can input their weight and height in multiple units (kg/lb for weight, cm/m/ft for height) and receive instant BMI results with corresponding health category classifications. The calculator is complemented by a clear BMI category index table, helping users better understand their health metrics. This project demonstrates form handling, unit conversions, and dynamic DOM updates using JavaScript.
